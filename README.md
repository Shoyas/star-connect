âœ… Testing Everything

ðŸ‘‰ Checking
Test 1 â€” Check ESLint manually

```bash
npm run lint
```

ðŸ‘‰ See if ESLint shows warnings/errors.

Test 2 â€” Auto-fix ESLint issues

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

ðŸ‘‰ ESLint should fix as much as it can automatically.

Test 3 â€” Format your code

```bash
npm run format
```

ðŸ‘‰ Prettier should reformat everything cleanly.

Test 4 â€” Git Commit Testing (Husky)
Modify a .ts or .tsx file badly (wrong spacing, etc.).

```bash
git add .

git commit -m "Here will be your First Commit"
```

ðŸ‘‰ Husky will automatically run lint-staged and fix or block commit if errors.
If everything is clean â†’ commit will happen successfully.
